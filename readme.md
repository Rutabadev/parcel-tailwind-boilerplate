# Parcel Tailwind Boilerplate

This is a basic web development boilerplate with useful tools:

-  Parcel : bundling, hmr...
-  TailwindCSS : CSS utilities
-  posthtml-include : add `<include src="..."/>` tags to html to add partials (html fragments)
-  postcss-nesting : SASS style nesting but without SASS for speed because PostCSS is already used for Tailwind

## Usage

Install the dependencies with 

```shell
npm i
```

Run the project with
```shell
npm run dev
```

Build the project with
```shell
npm run build
```
